    <h1>Cinnamon Roll Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../src/cinnamon roll.jpg">
    <p>A cinnamon bun, also known as a cinnamon roll,
     is a delectable pastry characterized by its sweet 
     and aromatic flavor profile. Composed of a soft and fluffy 
     yeast dough, the bun is generously layered with a mixture 
     of cinnamon, brown sugar, and butter, which contributes to 
     its irresistible taste. The dough is rolled into a spiral 
     shape, creating distinct layers that puff up during baking, 
     resulting in a tender and pillowy texture.</p>
